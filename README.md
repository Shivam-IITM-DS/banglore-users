1. Explanation of Scraping
    1. First of all, I generated a token for Github API with validity of 30 days.
    2. Then using the criteria provided (i.e. location:Banglore & followers>=100), searched the users.
    3. After I have the result for the users meeting the specified criteria, I fetched the User   details for every user in my list.
    4. Similarly I fetched the repository information for all the users in our list.
    5. Stored all the fetched data into csv files, done for each Users and Repositries individually.
